        <h3>Section 3</h3>
            <p>We need a new food pyramid.

                I’m not talking about a drastic change that’ll require years of planning from the Department of Agriculture and an unfathomable amount of tax dollars. I don’t think everyone in the country will even need access to this new food pyramid—it’s really just for Southerners on special occasions. More specifically, when we’re in line at our favorite meat and three.
                
                The idea came to me recently after standing on the hallowed ground known as Niki’s West. Actually, I was briskly walking on the hallowed ground. Standing still isn’t allowed when you’re at the famous lunch counter.</p>
