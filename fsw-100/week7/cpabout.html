    <h1>The Why</h1>
        <p>Life has become too hectic, too rushed, too impersonal. The busier people get, the more they need to slow things down, to unplug from technology, to reconnect with family, friends and themselves. Pottery painting is simply a venue for rejuvenating the soul. It provides an opportunity for relaxed social interaction, creative exploration and simple hands-on play.  We call it FUN ART, not fine art.  Anyone can do it …and everyone should!</p>

    <h1>Everyone Can Have Fun!</h1>
        <p>Baby we love your toes! We capture precious hand prints and footprints on pottery for the best gifts and keepsakes ever.
            Hands-free kids! We help parents replace screen time with creative time…so kids grow up curious, confident and playful.
            Ladies its your turn to play! Women get together with us to chatter and splatter, gab and dab, giggle and squiggle… socializing over pottery, creating fun art and friendships.
            More Family Time! We bring families members of every age and ability together in an activity that everyone can enjoy.
            Best birthdays ever! We host creative birthday parties that kids and parents both love…with a “loot bag” that lasts forever.</p>
